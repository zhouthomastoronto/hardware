		<ol id= "Glossary">
			<li>System Unit: The plastic or metal box that contains primary devices that perform operations and produce results for complex calculations. The system unit is also known as a chassis or tower. (Techopedia, n.d.)</li>
			
			<li>I/O Panel: This is where you plug in all the connectors (peripherals). Examples: headphone/speaker, microphone, modem, USB, keyboard, mouse, video cables. (Dummies, n.d.)</li>
			
			<li>USB: Universal Serial Bus - A common interface that enables communication between devices and a host controller such as a personal computer. It is usually small and very portable. (Techopedia, n.d.)</li>

			<li>Heat sink: A heat sink incorporates a fan or other means to keep a hot component, such as the processor, cool. There are two types of heat sinks. Active heat sinks use the computer’s power supply as well as the fans. Passive heat sinks use means of convection and are made of an aluminum-finned radiator that dissipates heat. For passive heat sinks to work correctly, there must be a steady airflow across the fins. (Computer Hope, 2018, May 21)</li>

			<li>Power Supply Unit: Also known as the PSU, it converts AC current to DC current, which is a requirement for the computer. For the computer to run smoothly without overheating, the voltage on the PSU is regulated to an adequate amount. (TechTerms, 2009, January 28)</li>

			<li>Hard Disk Drive: A secondary storage used to store data permanently. It is non-volatile and contains magnetic disks (or platters) that rotate at high speeds. Non-volatile means that the data remains when the computer is turned off. (Techopedia, n.d.)</li>

			<li>Motherboard: “A printed circuit board containing the principal components of a computer or other device, with connectors into which other circuit boards can be slotted”</li>

			<li>The motherboard is a printed circuit board that is the foundation of a computer, located on the back side or at the bottom of the computer chassis. It allocates power and allows communication to the CPU, RAM, and all other computer hardware components. (Computer Hope, 2017, October 30)</li>

			<li>CD-ROM Drive: Short for Compact Disk-Read Only Memory, the CD-ROM Drive is a high capacity optical data storage device with a removable disk. It writes data on a storage medium, or reads 	data from one. It has speeds of reading CD-ROMs, ranging from 1x to 72x, which means it can read CDs 72 times faster than the 1x version. (Computer Hope, 2018, April 1)</li>

			<li>Fan: A fan is a hardware device that keeps the overall computer or a computer device cool by circulating air to or from the computer or component. (Computer Hope, 2018, April 1)</li>

			<li>RAM: RAM stands for Random Access Memory, and keeps many application programs and data that are currently in use. It is also where the operating system is kept. RAM is much faster to read from or write to than other kinds of storage, making it the computer’s main memory. (TechTarget, n.d.)</li>

			<li>ROM: ROM stands for Read Only Memory, and is “built in” computer memory. It contains data that can usually only be read. The programming that allows your computer to be booted up or regenerated every time it is turned on is contained in ROM. The data in ROM is not erased when the computer is turned off. (TechTarget, n.d.)</li>
